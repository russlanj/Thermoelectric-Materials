# thermoelectric_materials
This is a supplementary file for our work "A deep learning perspective into the figure-of-merit of thermoelectric materials"
NOTE: all of the features in this work have been generated using the Magpie software, for more info please visit: https://wolverton.bitbucket.io/
This file includes :
1. "Initial_ Data + References.xlsx" file that includes all of the training and testing data that is being used in this work. This is a raw file and not to meant to be used as an input to the DL model
2. "Training_data.csv" has the data to be split into training and testing, as well as the features that have been generated for each composition.
3. "Code.py" file that includes all the codes (marked-down) that is needed to replicate this work and experiment further.
4. "system_predictions.rar" folder  that has the ZT predictions for over 300,000 composition for four thermoelectric systems (SnSe, PbTe, BiTe, and SiGe) + more if needed
